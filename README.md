# TeaLightAdapter

A simple adapter bracket to hold Tea Light for holiday decorations.

I have included the generated STL for the object, as rendered from OpenSCAD, as well as the design file, and a 3MF file which includes print recommendations.

All of the code/files are contained within GitHub - TeaLightAdapter

git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jshessen/TeaLightAdapter.git
